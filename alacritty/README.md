In Kubuntu, you can set a custom keyboard shortcut to launch Alacritty using the following steps:

- Open System Settings. You can usually find it in the application launcher or by right-clicking on the desktop and selecting "System Settings."
- In System Settings, find and select "Shortcuts" or "Shortcuts and Gestures." It's typically located in the "Hardware" section.
- In the Shortcuts settings, choose "Custom Shortcuts" from the menu on the left.
- Click on the "Edit" menu and select "New" -> "Global Shortcut" -> "Command/URL."
- A dialog box will appear. In the "Trigger" tab, click on the "None" button, then press the key combination you want to assign to launch Alacritty.
- Switch to the "Action" tab. In the "Command/URL" field, enter the command to launch Alacritty, which is typically just alacritty.
- Click "Apply" or "OK" to save the shortcut.

Now, whenever you press the key combination you set, Alacritty should open on your Kubuntu system.
